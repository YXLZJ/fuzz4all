/* The 'goto' statement in C is used to transfer program control unconditionally to a desired location within the same function scope. It is mainly utilized when conventional constructs fail to relocate the control. The syntax involves the keyword 'goto' followed by a targeted label, which is an identifier followed by a colon (:), and a statement. However, this jump is not permitted if it would enter the scope of a variable-length array or another variably-modified type. Entering the scope of a non-variably modified variable is allowed, although the variable will be treated as uninitialized. If 'goto' leaves the scope of a variable-length array, this is deallocated and may be reallocated upon re-execution of its initialization. Note that declarations are not statements, hence a null statement (semicolon) is needed if a label is before a declaration or the block's end. */
/* Please create a short program which combines goto with new C features in a complex way */
