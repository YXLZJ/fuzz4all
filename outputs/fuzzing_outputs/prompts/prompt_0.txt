/* The `goto` statement in C language is used to unconditionally transfer control to a specified location in the code, which is identified by a label. A label, having function scope, can be used anywhere within the same function it appears and is created by an identifier followed by a colon and a statement. The `goto` statement is particularly used when conventional control flow structures aren't able to achieve the desired control transfer. However, it cannot be used to jump into the scope of a variable-length array or any other variably-modified type. Also, If `goto` leaves the scope of a Variable Length Array (VLA), it is deallocated. Furthermore, since declarations are not statements, a null statement is needed when a label is before a declaration or before the end of a block. */
/* Please create a short program which combines goto with new C features in a complex way */
